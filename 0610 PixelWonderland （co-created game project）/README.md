# README

* The game requires the installation of two libraries: 
  
  1. GifAnimation 
  
  2. Sound library （developed by Processing）

* If the game cannot be opened due to memory issues, please go to the toolbar, select File => Preferences, and find the Memory option to change its value. 
  The required value varies for each person.
  
  （The only feedback we have received from one of our member is setting it to 10000 MB.）

* Note: Because data needs to be loaded, please wait at the beginning when entering the game and after completing the first level.
