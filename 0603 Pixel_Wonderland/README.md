# README

* This is the group final project for the Creative Programming course. Art was done by YuLou, the main programming was done by me, and the auxiliary programming was handled by Angie and Emma.

* The game requires the installation of two libraries: GifAnimation and the Sound library developed by Processing.

* If the game cannot be opened due to memory issues, please go to the toolbar, select File => Preferences, and find the Memory option to change its value. The required value varies for each person; the only feedback we have received so far suggests setting it to 10000 MB.
